Built with a clean hexagonal architecture for maintainability and extensibility.

- Clean Architecture - Ports & adapters pattern for easy testing and extension

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package manager

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CompanyRating

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install Playwright browsers (required for Kununu scraping)
uv run playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

### Start Everything

```bash
make docker-up
```

This will:
- Build both frontend and backend images
- Start containers with proper networking
- Mount data directory for persistence
- Expose services on localhost

### Access the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Daily Workflow

**1. Scrape Jobs**

Run the daily scraping routine to fetch new jobs:

```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

This performs:
- Job scraping from LinkedIn and Indeed
- Blacklist filtering
- Deduplication
- Data persistence to `data/jobs.jsonl`

### Alternative Company Names

Some companies appear with different names on job boards vs. rating sites:

```bash
# 1. Export companies without ratings
# Edit src/main.py: task = Tasks.EXPORT
uv run src/main.py

# 2. Edit data/companies_missing_ratings.csv
# Fill alternative_name column with correct Kununu names
# Use "void" for companies not on Kununu

# 3. Import and re-scrape
# Edit src/main.py: task = Tasks.IMPORT
uv run src/main.py
```

## Configuration

### Search Parameters

Edit `src/infrastructure/scrapers/jobspy_scraper.py`:

```python
search_terms = [
    "JOB TITLE 1",
    "Fullstack JOB TITLE 2",
    "AI JOB TITLE 3",
    "...",
]

location = "YOURPLACEOFWORK"
hours_old = 24 * 7  # Last 7 days
results_wanted = 100
```

### Task Selection

Edit `src/main.py` to change the execution task:

```python
task = Tasks.DAILY   # Daily job scraping
task = Tasks.EXPORT  # Export companies missing ratings
task = Tasks.IMPORT  # Import alternative names and re-scrape
```

## Data Files

All data stored in the `data/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `companies.jsonl` | Company data with ratings |
| `jobs.jsonl` | Scraped job listings |
| `company_blacklist.txt` | Hidden companies |
| `job_blacklist.txt` | Hidden job IDs |
| `companies_missing_ratings.csv` | Manual name correction workflow |
| `filtered_*.csv` | Exported results |

## Architecture

Built with **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters):

- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic, framework-agnostic
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (file I/O, web scraping)
- **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces (Streamlit, CLI)

Benefits:
- Easy to test
- Swappable implementations (file storage → database)
- Clear separation of concerns

## Notes

- **Rate Limiting**: Kununu scraper includes 1-5s delays for respectful scraping
- **Stealth Mode**: Playwright uses anti-detection techniques
- **German Market**: Optimized for German job market (Indeed DE, Kununu)
- **Privacy**: All data stored locally, no external services required
